    <p>Night Nature Flower represents the uniqueness of night flowers in each season and brings an awareness of how people’s actions affect the environment. It encourages people to pay more attention to the night nature and enjoys their experience with colorful and creative designs</p>

<h2>Design & Composition</h2>
<div id="reference">
<img src="reference.PNG" alt="reference" style="width:500px;height:250px;padding: 20px;">
</div>

<p1>From the beginning, I planned to design a flower based on my reference. I could make the design become similar, but I could not make it move like the references. It was too complicated for me, so I decided to adapt to my own style.</p1>
</section>

<section class="elements">
  <div id="typeofflower">
  <img src="ProjectA.png" alt="ProjectA" style="width:400px;height:400px;padding: 20px">
 </div>
  <p2>I designed 3 types of flowers: Winter, Summer, and Seasonal flowers. Even though each has its own uniqueness and movement, they are all in random colors to give the users a sense of colorfulness in life.</p2>
</section>

<section class="type">
  <h3>Type of Flowers</h3>
  <div class="row">
  <div id="Seasonalflower">
    <img src="Seasonalflower.png" alt="Seasonalflower" style="width:380px;height:300px;padding: 20px;">
   </div>
  </div>
    <p3>For Seasonal Flower, my original idea was to have only 2 types of flowers as a background. I asked my friends to give me a suggestion to make my project look more interesting, and they told me to add more flowers or change one of the designs to make my project stand out. I decided to add one more flower and place them at the center to attract more attention.</p3>
   
    <div id="winterflower">
      <img src="winterflower.png" alt="winterflower" style="width:350px;height:300px;padding: 20px;">
     </div>
      <p4>For the Winter flower, I designed it to become similar to the snowflakes since it can symbolize Winter Season. First, I added the rectangle to decorate beside the flower as the reference, but I think that it will look better without it. I decided to remove them and have only flowers. For the movement, I wanted to make it rotate() and bounce() within the canvas. As Winter is the shortest season, I made it rotate around a small circle to represent the ‘Cycle Of Flowers’.</p4>
  
      <div id="summerflower">
        <img src="summerflower.png" alt="summerflower" style="width:380px;height:300px;padding: 20px;">
       </div>
        <p5>For Summer Flower, I designed the petal to be over each other, so it will become beautiful when the movement is involved. As Summer is the season that flowers will be fully developed, I tried to stimulate their movement to make it more realistic. I used an adjustScale() function to make it enlarge() like the flower is blooming, and shrink() like the flower is withering. Later, I added rotate() and bounce() randomly within the canvas to represent the ‘Cycle Of Flower’ like Winter Flower.</p5>
